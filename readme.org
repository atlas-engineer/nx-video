This video downloader was included in Nyxt until 1.5 (called Next back then).

It's mostly an interface to youtube-dl.
It has a few shortcoming though: It does not show progress, it does not allow
for cancelling, it does not reuse the Nyxt download interface.

Ideally, we would overhaul the Nyxt download interface to support multiple
backends, youtube-dl included.
